          Hachikō was a Japanese Akita dog, sometimes referred to as the “faithful dog Hachikō”. He was born at a farm in Ōdate, Akita Prefecture, Japan on November 10, 1923.

          On 1924, he was adopted as a pet by Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the Tokyo Imperial University and was brought to Shibuya, Tokyo. Each day, Ueno would commute to work leaving Hachikō at home, and by the end of the day, Hachikō would go to the nearby Shibuya Station to greet Ueno. This routine continues on until May 21, 1925, when Ueno did not return after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage during a lecture.

          The professor died without ever returning to the train station where Hachikō waited. For the next 9 years, 9 months and 15 days, Hachikō appears at the station and waits until his owner’s return. Hachikō died on March 8,  1935 at the age of 11. After being found at the streets of Shibuya, scientists have found that the cause of his death was due to terminal cancer and filarial infection.

          Hachikō became a national sensation due to his faithfulness to his master’s memory, which eventually became a symbol of loyalty.
